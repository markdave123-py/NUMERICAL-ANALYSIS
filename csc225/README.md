# NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS

This code is used to find the root(solution) to polynomial equations and Ordinary Differential Equations.
Using iteration and recursion, you cn easily find the solution to an ODE and the root of an equation.

This code utilizes
1.Bisection method
2.Newton-Raphson Method
3.Secant Method.

for solutions to polynomial equations.

4.Euler's method
5.Picard's method
6.Talyor's method

for solutions to ODE.
